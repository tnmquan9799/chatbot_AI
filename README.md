# Implementation of a Music Chatbot in PyTorch.  
Simple chatbot implementation with PyTorch.
This chatbot supports `speech-recognition`


## Installation

### Create an environment
Install `python` 3.6 or above first

### Install libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

Run:
 ```console
pip install requirements.txt
 ```

If you get an error during the first run, you also need to install `nltk.tokenize.punkt`:
Run this once in your terminal:
 ```console
$ python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Usage
Run
```console
python train.py
```
This will dump `data.pth` file. And then run
```console
python chat.py
```
## Customize
Have a look at [intents.json](intents.json). You can customize it according to your own use case. Just define a new `tag`, possible `patterns`, and possible `responses` for the chat bot. You have to re-run the training whenever this file is modified.

For music, just say your current mood and the bot will do the rest (only support `sad` and `happy` for now).
```console
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": [
        "Hi",
        "Hey",
        "How are you",
        "Is anyone there?",
        "Hello",
        "Good day"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "Hey :-)",
        "Hello, thanks for visiting",
        "Hi there, what can I do for you?",
        "Hi there, how can I help?"
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
